Well, the Octopress experiment is over - It seemed a bit too complex to be able to change a theme in the way I wanted... And using plain old vanilla Jekyll seemed to work find - especially when it comes to applying themes like Bootstrap.  So now I'm back to using plain old jekyll.  I need to clean a few things up, but aside from moving code snippets back to a pygments way of defining. I'm set!

That should mean I blog and have more content on this site...
