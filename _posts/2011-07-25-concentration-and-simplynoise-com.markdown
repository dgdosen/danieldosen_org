I'm a fan of using white noise  -  mainly from using a floor fan in my bedroom on summer nights to drown out the noisy streets.  It drowns out any noise wafting up from 35th street - and there's plenty of noise on that street.

It turns out I'm also a big fan of white noise when working - or my favorite brown noise from simplynoise.com.  Combine that and the ticking of a pomodoro and my ADHDness melts away.  

It looks like you need to donate to download some of their noise - which is worth a dollar to me, considering I just spent four dollars on a latte that is just plain not very good.  Sorry Cafe Ladro, the only thing you have going for you are your late hours.
