# Very cool header

## An even cooler header

Trying to look at using markdown and vim together...

### Header 3
> What the dog saw

Things VIM is good at:

* Fast Editing
* Fast Navigation
* Efficient use of time
* Multiple Buffers open at the same time
* Solarized
* Other Stuff

Trying an image:

Looking at code snippets...
Here's a post in cucumber:

{% highlight ruby %}
    Feature: Manage pomodori
      In order to [goal]
      [stakeholder]
      wants [behaviour]
      
      # test comment
      Scenario: Register new pomodori
        Given I am on the new pomodori page
        And I press "Create"
{% endhighlight %}

And here's a ruby post:

{% highlight ruby %}
    class Account
      # what's up, fool?
      def init
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}
