OK, now this is geeky, but I needed to share it.  Take your iPad and add a VNC client (I added Remoter, which is 99 cents of bugginess).  Now use your iPad with a BT keyboard and connect the VNC client to a Mac Lion machine - or VM.  Start up iTerm on the host and VIM away...

This image may look a little ugly, but Remoter doesn't seem to hang on to my keyboard unless I have the onscreen keyboard up.  Luckily, you can just alpha it away...

I wanted to see how snappy this would be using an iPad over my iPhone Personal Hotspot sharing... and it's kind of nice!  Now I need a stand for the iPad.

I also need to stay within VIM or iTerm2 when doing git checkins.  I haven't really tried fugitive.vim, because gitx is so nice.  I think I'll have to give it a shot.
