Tim Ferriss has a podcast - some call it a bro-science podcast - and in it, he sometimes mentions this idea of winning the morning.  There are five things he does to start the day so that, in his words, if he gets them done, he's won the morning.  I can agree with that.

Here's a link to a version of how he makes that list: [5 Morning Rituals That
Help You 'Win the
Day'](https://www.inc.com/chris-winfield/5-morning-rituals-that-help-you-win-the-day-.html).

In short - here's that list, in no particular order, of which I kind of use:

- Make your bed: self explanatory
- Hang: (some kind of exercise) but somewhere he mentioned hanging - and that's particularly good for something like shoulder mobility because, hey - I'm over 50... That's my reason anyway.
- Tea: I drink green tea - Costco sells it by the gross (it might be five times that), so I appear to have at least a year's supply
- Journal: writing stuff down...  I've done this for about 9 months straight - and while I'm big on writing notes in general, the idea of this has helped me to find a workflow where I can write and maybe event post online somehow
- Meditate: I've been doing this for a few months.  I try 10 minutes a day and have used apps like Headspace and Oak - right now, it's such a routine, I just use the Oak app.  As of late, that data all integrates with Apple Watch health data, so I can see when I skip a day or two...

So that's his list and my interpretation.  That's fine, I think it's a good idea, but in my personal experience, winning the morning isn't winning the day.  You need some way to shift from this theoretical winning to actual winning. So how do you create that metric?

Much of the work I do now correlates to check-ins on some git repository, so there's my answer.  Get five check-in during the morning, and then I consider that winning the morning in both the 'theoretical' and 'empirical' way.  One thing about using a metric like check-ins to git - it's also a way to force 'pulling on a kanban', as I look it as a way to pull five things through my workflow.   So, right off the bat, you can see that I have a pretty low bar for checking stuff into a repo :)

So, I'm shifting to that.  I look at winning the morning in two ways:

- Theoretical: this list above
- Empirical: a simple metric of five check-ins.

Who's with me?
