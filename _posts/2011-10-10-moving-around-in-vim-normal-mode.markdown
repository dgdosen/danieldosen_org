So, while I'm getting much better with vim, my only complaint as of a couple of days ago, was, IMO, my constant use of jklm/bw in normal mode. Specifically, when navigating around in a file, I found myself hitting too many  j's and k's to get to the right line, and then a bunch of b's or w's to get to the spot in that line that I want to edit. 

I know how to use Ff - but they didn't seem that great of an option.  That's why I switched to EasyMotion and remapped (this may be considered sacrilege) my f and F to easymotion - w and easymotion - b.  Now, I can find myself zipping around in a file.  It's pretty automatic, and I'm just wondering if other vim users do the same, or do they consider that too costly of a hack.  I mean, I never used f or F until now...
