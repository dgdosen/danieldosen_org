I'm sitting here at Apple's Developer Conference and reflecfting on the week and
am pretty suprised at how complete and easy it is to work with Swfit, Apple's
new development language.  I'm sure it means different things to different
people.  I've heard dozen's of comments like "It's just like Ruby, but with
named params and curly braces" or "Looks like CSharp to me"... or Scala, or
whatever.  You get the idea that there's tons copied from other 

Playgrounds and a REPL are very welcome to me.  I find it very similar to a
Clojure REPL or even using Pry in a Rails project.  All very awesome, and all
very cool ways to flush out ideas.  Part of me thinks that 

swift 1.2

Ideas:

- Tie into how people learn
- Try into "experimenting"
- Playgrounds?
