I really should set `published: false` for some of these posts...

...But since I'm here, I now see the value in using Markdown - especially in an editor like VIM.  I've also loaded some helper mappings for using the spell checker when I write. It's pretty fast! I think finding a spell checker was my last big hangup for using VIM.  

So now I'm now a convert.  

Since getting this environment setup was so easy on my macs - I got out an old netbook with Ubuntu intalled, and I've pretty much got the same enironment working there!  Not that I'll ever use it, but it's pretty easy.  It makes me think there should be an easy way to do all of this over ssh to a desktop, from an iPad.
