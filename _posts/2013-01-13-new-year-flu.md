Happy New Year!  First post in like, a year, and I'm sitting at home with a nasty flu.  I figured getting my blog(s) and personal web sites updated was just the right amount of taxing my brain could use to keep me from falling asleep, yet still come nowhere near to adding to my weakened state.  I mean, blogging with Jekyll is a blast.  I was doing so, but in a moment of cheapness, I moved to Jekyll and pushed my built website to Heroku for free! The bad part about that is that Heroku won't keep your site spinned up unless it has users, and well, my writing style and content probably has a bit to be desired.

On top of that, I was using Octopress, then Jekyll-Bootstrap... Not I'm just using Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap - and when I tried to purge them from my site, I created a bit of a mess.  So much a mess that I let blogging slide for a while.  I really haven't done anything interesting as of yet.  We'll see where that goes.

But now we're back on target! I've got tons of "what about" kinds of posts in Evernote, that I figure I should just copy and paste into here.  If I deemed the topic interesting, well then, somebody else must have.

Enough for now...

More to come!
