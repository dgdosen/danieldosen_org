h1. Jekyll

I've been reading about Jekyll (on github) and it looks like a much more desirable way to host a website and related blog than wordpress. It works great because all your posts are stored as text using haml and kept under source control - It's makes it easy to work from anywhere, and gives you feature parity you could get with MarsEdit - but just easier to work with. 

It's so easy - it looks like stealing candy from a  baby! - What a lark, let's try!

This post is going to my wordpress blog, let's see how long it takes me to move it to Jekyll on github (not including DNS changes).

See you on the flip side.
