I just started reading Eric Ries' new book *The Lean Startup*.  
Almost right away, there's a section on the five principles of the Lean Startup.  Number 5 jumps out at me:

Number 5 - **Innovation Accounting**  

>To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff:  how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work.  This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups-and the people who hold them accountable. 

Now, that's kind of exciting to me.  Here I've got this accounting system that I wrote and use for myself.  While I use it for financial accounting for small businesses (HOAs) I want to take it to another level - and help startups with it.  But as this principle notes, they need *more* than pretty invoices and automated billing, they need innovation accounting.  Sure he may call it boring, but to capture and measure that data - is right up the alley of the kinds of apps I create.  I'm kind of giddy after reading this, as I can see the synergy here.  

Taken to another level, here in Seattle, I know Jim Benson and David Anderson - two pioneers in using lean methodologies for software development.  Why can't I get guidance from them on creating the cool kinds of metrics and integrate that stuff together.  I think there's more than a germ of an idea here, and I just the petri dish to incubate it.
