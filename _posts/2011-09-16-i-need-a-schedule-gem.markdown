So, this is what I need - Well, this is what I wanted before I started out thinking I should build a Schedule gem:

<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/maptini.com/app/public/system/images/34389/original/06f9e830-b375-012e-3f0a-12313d0361e4.png?1328034042" width="800" alt="Scheduling Gem">

The problem is, I really haven't found any schedule gems that I like.

What I want, is to be able to create a schedule, in a manner very similar to the API shown on the ice\_cube gem - but with more than just an API, as I want something that's easy to show on a Rails (or Formtastic) form.  So, why not build a new one... That's where I'm at right now.  I'll let you know where it goes.
