I saw [this link](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html "100-up") in today's NY Times.  Everything mentioned in this article seems to be in sync with what I've learned from Chi-Running - but just presented in a way that makes it much easier and more natural to understand.   Gotto go try this!
